<div>Andrew Carnegie was born into a typical lower-class family in Scotland and lived in a weaver’s cottage; a tiny house.

The main room served not only as the living quarters but also the dining room and the bedroom for the whole family.

His family were suffering from near starvation and poverty when William; his father emigrated the family to Allegheny, Pennsylvania in the USA. The area in which they lived was very poor but better than their previous community in Fife.

His first job was that of a bobbin boy, paid $1.20-a-week, where he helped change spools for 12hrs each day. Feeling this wasn’t the career for him, he became a telegraph messenger for $2.50 per week. This job came with a couple of perks too, such as gaining free entry to the local theater. He soon progressed to $4.00 per week at the age of 18yrs and through hard work and rapid development Andrew climbed swiftly through the ranks. Eventually he became an investor, investing the money he had saved over the years into Adams Express Company, a messenger service.

Carnegie later received shares in a car business after helping to safeguard the shares of another business for a friend; he used this to his advantage and reinvested all his money into the railway industry. During the civil war Carnegie made a fortune through investments he had made; one of which had him investing $40,000 of his own money into Story Farm; a creek rich in oil. By the end of the year the investment had paid off in dividends to the tidy sum of $1 million, with more profits coming in from the petrol and oil goods.

<b><i>To try to make the world in some way better than you found it is to have a noble motive in life.</i>
Andrew Carnegie</b>
After the civil war had finished Carnegie gave $40,000 to help build a library in his native Dunfermline, he also gave $50,000 of his money to a hospital college to help teach more nurses and save more lives.</div>

        Steve jobs, you either love him or hate him but there’s one thing that is certain; you will definitely know who is. One thing that you might not know him about him is that he’s adopted, but that didn’t stop him becoming one the most successful people in the world and why should it.

When Jobs graduated from high school in 1972, one of his first jobs out of high school was as a technician for the computer company Atari. This was possibly a big turning point for Steve.

In 1974, the same year Jobs first worked with Atari, jobs went into business with his old friend Steve Wozniak. Jobs had convinced Steve Wozniak that it would be a good idea to assemble computers and sell them on for a profit. It seemed to decent idea as they soon started making a profit from the computers they were making, and on April 1, 1976 Apple Computer company was founded as a partnership with Steven jobs and Steve Wozniak as the co-founders.

Within just 4 years of the Apple Computer Company being founded, Apple became a publicly traded corporation, and in 1983 jobs lured John Scully away from the Pepsi-Cola company. Jobs went on in leaps and bounds, and in 1984 on January 26th jobs introduced the first Apple Macintosh. It wasn’t all pleasantries, though; in May 1985, following an internal power struggle between the board of directors, Jobs lost control of the Apple computer company and was forced out; although he did still have shares in the business.

Steve Jobs then formed another company – NeXT computers which did well. Then in 1986 he bought “The Graphics Group” which was later named Pixar Animation, for $10 million.

Some time later, in 1996, Apple computers company bought the NeXT company for approximately $429 million, bringing Steve jobs back to Apple as the company’s interim CEO. In 2000 Apple announced publicly that Steve Jobs was to become the permanent CEO of the company.

One of my favorite Steve Jobs quotes is this one that he made, aged 33. It seems a perfect question to ask oneself, no matter what age you are.</div> </p>

<div> Jeff Bezos was born in 1964 and is the founder of the president and the chief executive officer and the Chairman of the board for one of the most popular and well-known websites/e-commerce sites in the world, Amazon.com. He is also according to Forbes the richest Billionaire in the world.
Jeff Bezos mother was just a teenage girl when he was born in Albuquerque New Mexico, she married his father which lasted only one year and when Jeff was just five years old; she remarried the man he recalls his father – Miguel Bezos.

They moved to Texas, and Miguel became an engineer for Exxon. Jeff Bezos was very interested in scientific projects at an early age and got into a lot of trouble by reading up small electric alarms to keep his siblings out of his bedroom. He persuaded his parents to convert their garage into his own personal laboratory, which suited him just fine.

He was was highly regarded through his school and college years and was awarded an honorary doctorate in science and technology from Carnegie Mellon University in 2008.

After finally graduating from Princeton University, Jeff Bezos decided he wanted to work in computer science field and began working on Wall Street.

In 1994 after having an idea on a cross-country trip from New York to Seattle Jeff Bezos came up with a business plan for what would be called, Amazon.

He got some backing and started Internet business that very year and as we know it is now one of the most successful e-commerce sites in the world. Amazon.com has a revenue of around $25 billion.

Not bad, for an idea he came up with in the back of a car on a road trip.

2020 Update: According to some reports, Jeff Bezos’s net worth has grown by 34% on average over the last five years. This could see him become the world’s first trillionaire by 2026, when he will be aged 62.</p>
